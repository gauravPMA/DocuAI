You are calling `save_pretrained` to a 4-bit converted model, but your `bitsandbytes` version doesn't support it. If you want to save 4-bit models, make sure to have `bitsandbytes>=0.41.3` installed.
You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama_fast.LlamaTokenizerFast'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
